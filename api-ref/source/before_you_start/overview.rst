Overview
========

Welcome to *Elastic Cloud Server API Reference*. An Elastic Cloud Server (ECS) is an easy-to-obtain, elastically scalable computing server that consists of a CPU, memory, image, and EVS disks. An ECS can work with a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), virtual firewall, and multiple copies of data to build an efficient, reliable, and secure computing environment to let your services run stably. After creating an ECS, you can use it like using your local computer or physical server.

This document describes ECS application programming interfaces (APIs), including description, syntax, parameters, and examples. For details about all supported operations, see :ref:`API Overview <en-us_topic_0124306060>`.

If you plan to access ECSs through an API, ensure that you are familiar with ECS concepts. For details, see "Service Overview" in the *Elastic Cloud Server User Guide*.
